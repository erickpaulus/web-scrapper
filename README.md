# Web Scrapper Project using  Python, BeautifulSoup and Selenium
This repository contains my experiments to scrap open data in a certain web page using Python, BeautifulSoup and Selenium. 

It involves Selenium WebDriver and a web browser driver like ChromeDriver. 

The steps are follow:

1. Install Selenium WebDriver 
```
pip install selenium 
```

2. Download and set up a WebDriver for your preferred web browser. For example, if you want to use Chrome, download ChromeDriver from the official website (https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/), unzip the executable, and install it in your project folder or any directory you prefer.
for stable version, you can take from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable. Please remember the chromedriver.exe path where you unzip it. FOr example, I set in C:\Users\ep\Downloads\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver.exe

3. write your code in Python. please see in jupyter notebook file inside this repository.
